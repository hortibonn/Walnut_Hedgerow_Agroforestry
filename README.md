# Walnut Alley Cropping â€“ Decision-Support App

A Shiny web application to support decision-making for agroforestry transitions on a vegetable/arable farm in **Belgium (Flanders)**.

Developed as part of the [ReFOREST â€“ Reshaping agro-ecosystems through agroforestry](https://www.reforest-eu.com) Horizon EU project.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

The app compares economic, labour and carbon outcomes of a **walnut-based alley cropping system** vs. a **treeless baseline system**.

Users can:

- Select field, crop and agroforestry parameters via dynamic UI elements.
- Add government or private funding schemes.
- Run Monte Carlo simulations with uncertainty ranges.
- Explore results through visual plots (NPV, cashflows, carbon, labour, etc.).
